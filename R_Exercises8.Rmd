# Setup

First, clone the [Assignment8][1] repository to your own GitHub account
by forking. Look for the forking button on the GitHub repository page.

You can then modify the repository (namely the `R_Exercises8.Rmd` file)
and complete the assignment by adding your answers in the appropriate
place. Do **NOT** rename the file.

## Completing the assignment

Check your work by knitting the document.

1. Create a level 2 header below in Markdown with the name "Answer 1".
## "Answer 1"


2. Add an unordered Markdown list of your favorite food dishes and
add their ingredients as sub-items in the list. You should enter at least two
dishes with two ingredients each.
* Favorite Food. Taboli Salad
  *quinoq
  *parsley
  olive oil
  
*Lentil Stew
 *lentils
 Cumin
 Curry


3. Insert an R code chunk below. Show the `summary` of the `Orange` dataset.
Run a linear regression using the `lm` function to predict `circumference` from
`age` and assign the result. Show the `summary` of the fit object that you
assigned.
orange_fit<-lm(circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
Sum(orange_fit)





Call:
lm(formula = circumference ~ age, data = Orange)

Residuals:
